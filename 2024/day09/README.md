# Day 9: Disk Fragmenter

## Puzzle1
Compact the amphipod's hard drive using the process he requested. What is the resulting filesystem checksum?

* [Code](./puzzle1.py) => `6386640365805`

## Puzzle2
Attempt to move whole files to the leftmost span of free space blocks that could fit the file.

Start over, now compacting the amphipod's hard drive using this new method instead. What is the resulting filesystem checksum?

* [Code](./puzzle2.py) => `6423258376982`
