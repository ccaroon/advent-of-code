# Day 5: Print Queue

## Puzzle1
Safety protocols clearly indicate that new pages for the safety manuals must be printed in a very specific order. The notation X|Y means that if both page number X and page number Y are to be produced as part of an update, page number X must be printed at some point before page number Y.

Determine which updates are already in the correct order. What do you get if you add up the middle page number from those correctly-ordered updates?
