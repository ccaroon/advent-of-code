# Day 8: Resonant Collinearity

## Puzzle1
Calculate the impact of the signal. How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?

* [Code](./puzzle1.py) => `256`

## Puzzle2
It turns out that an antinode occurs at any grid position exactly in line with at least two antennas of the same frequency, **regardless of distance**.
 This means that some of the new antinodes will occur at the position of each antenna (unless that antenna is the only one of its frequency).

Calculate the impact of the signal using this updated model. How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?

* [Code](./puzzle2.py) => `1005`
